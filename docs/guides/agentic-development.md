# AI Agentic Development — Useful Links & Best Practices

A curated reference for developers working with AI coding agents, covering both
**Claude Code** (Anthropic) and **OpenAI Codex**, plus the shared ecosystem standards
they both participate in.

## Claude Code

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| [Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs) | Official documentation hub |
| [Best Practices (official)](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices) | Core recommended workflows |
| [CLAUDE.md reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/core-concepts/claude-md) | How to write project instructions |
| [Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/advanced/hooks) | Shell commands triggered by agent events |
| [MCP integration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/advanced/mcp) | Connect external tools via Model Context Protocol |
| [Subagents / Tasks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/advanced/subagents) | Spawning specialist agents from an orchestrator |
| [Permissions & Sandbox](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/security/permissions) | Allowlisting commands, OS-level isolation |
| [Awesome Claude Code (community)](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code) | Skills, hooks, slash-commands, plugins |

### Key concepts

- **CLAUDE.md** — loaded at the start of every session; define commands, style,
  workflow rules, and agent ownership maps here.
- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — reusable, invocable prompt templates stored in
  the repo.
- **Hooks** — shell commands that fire on agent events (pre-tool, post-tool, etc.)
  to enforce guardrails or trigger side-effects.
- **MCP servers** — give the agent typed, sandboxed access to external tools
  (databases, APIs, filesystems) without prompt injection risk.

## OpenAI Codex

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| [Codex overview](https://developers.openai.com/codex/) | Official landing page |
| [AGENTS.md guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md/) | How Codex reads project instructions |
| [AGENTS.md spec (GitHub)](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/agents_md.md) | Full AGENTS.md format specification |
| [Use Codex with the Agents SDK](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-sdk/) | Integrating Codex into agent pipelines |
| [Agent Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/) | Codex skill definitions |
| [agents.md community site](https://agents.md/) | Ecosystem-wide AGENTS.md reference |

### Key concepts

- **AGENTS.md** — open format consumed by Codex, Claude Code, Amp, Cursor, and
  others. Layer global overrides (`AGENTS.override.md`) on top of repo-level files.
- **Test integration** — Codex will run test commands listed in AGENTS.md; document
  them explicitly.
- **AAIF (Agentic AI Foundation)** — cross-vendor standards effort; AGENTS.md is
  part of this convergence alongside MCP and Skills.

## Shared Ecosystem Standards

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Anthropic open standard (Nov 2024), now adopted by OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft.
Connects agents to tools and data sources through a typed, sandboxed protocol.

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25) | Official spec |
| [Wikipedia — MCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol) | Neutral overview |
| [Code execution with MCP (Anthropic Engineering)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp) | Deep dive on context efficiency |
| [mcp-agent (lastmile-ai)](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent) | OSS framework for MCP-based agents |

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A)

Google's April 2025 protocol for inter-agent messaging (complements MCP, which
handles agent-to-tool communication).

## Multi-Agent Architecture — Best Practices

1. **Declare ownership explicitly** — use `docs/agents/ownership.yml` (or
   equivalent) so each agent knows which paths it may write.
2. **Single orchestrator for conflicts** — specialist agents own their area;
   only the orchestrator resolves cross-area decisions.
3. **Instructions in-repo, not in prompts** — AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md keep
   instructions version-controlled and auditable.
4. **Context efficiency matters** — model accuracy drops with large context
   windows; use MCP to load tools on demand rather than front-loading everything.
5. **Session continuity** — write handoff files between sessions
   (see `docs/sessions/handoff-template.md`) so agents can resume cleanly.
6. **Sandbox risky operations** — use permission allowlists and OS-level
   sandboxing before running destructive commands.
7. **Test commands in AGENTS.md** — every agent must know how to run and verify
   tests for its area.
