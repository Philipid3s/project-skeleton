# Orchestrator Agent

## Scope

Plans work, delegates tasks to specialist agents, merges outputs, and resolves
cross-area conflicts. The orchestrator does **not** make domain changes directly.

## Execution Modes

### Native delegation mode

- Use real specialist sub-agents when the host runtime exposes callable
  delegation tools.
- Claude Code subagents count as native delegation for this policy.
- Prefer a capability check such as `spawn_agent` availability over relying on
  UI labels or runtime branding.
- When available, delegate each specialist task by passing the handoff packet
  below to the runtime's native delegation mechanism, such as Claude Code
  subagents or `spawn_agent`.
- Runtime agent classes such as `worker`, `default`, or similar host-provided
  labels are transport details only. They do not replace repository roles.
- The orchestrator must delegate to explicit repository specialists such as
  `frontend-agent`, `backend-agent`, `docs-agent`, `platform-agent`, or
  `qa-agent`, and must encode that role in the task packet.
- If the environment also exposes discovery or collection tools such as
  `list_agents` or `collect_agent_result`, use them to validate the target
  specialist and gather the result.
- If a native delegation capability is exposed but delegation fails because the
  session does not actually permit native delegation, switch immediately to
  strict single-session fallback mode.

### Strict single-session fallback mode

- Use this when native delegation is unavailable.
- The orchestrator still plans and issues task packets, but it must not stay as
  `Role: orchestrator` while editing specialist-owned paths.
- Instead, switch explicitly into the relevant specialist role for each scoped
  implementation pass, then switch back to `Role: orchestrator` for
  integration, conflict handling, and handoffs.
- Fallback mode is not permission to bypass ownership boundaries.

## File Ownership

Full read access to all paths. Write access only to resolve conflicts or update
cross-cutting files (e.g., root `AGENTS.md`, this `docs/agents/` directory,
`docs/sessions/`).

## Inputs

- User story or feature request
- Current repo state (branch, open tasks)
- Output reports from previous specialist runs
- Delegation tool availability (for example Claude Code subagents,
  `spawn_agent`, `list_agents`, `collect_agent_result`)

## Outputs

- Delegated task packets (one per specialist agent) - see handoff format below
- Integration report after all specialists complete
- ADR request and decision summary for `docs-agent` if a significant decision
  was made
- Session handoff file in `docs/sessions/` at end of session or when context is long

## Delegation Procedure

1. Detect whether native delegation tools are callable in the current runtime.
2. If a native delegation capability is available, stay in `Role: orchestrator`
   while issuing specialist task packets through that capability.
3. Ensure every delegated task names one repository specialist and includes an
   `active_role` that matches that specialist.
4. Ensure the delegated task message itself does not begin with
   `Role: orchestrator`, even if the parent orchestrator authored the handoff.
5. Ensure delegated outputs present themselves as the assigned specialist role,
   never as `Role: orchestrator`.
6. Wait for and collect specialist outputs through the runtime's result
   collection primitive.
7. If native delegation tools are not available, or if a delegation attempt
   fails because the runtime does not actually allow sub-agents, switch to the
   matching specialist role and follow strict single-session fallback rules.

## Role Signaling

- In single-chat interfaces, the orchestrator labels its own responses with
  `Role: orchestrator`
- When presenting specialist outputs, the orchestrator names the originating
  agent explicitly
- Durable outputs written by the orchestrator must include a `Prepared By`
  field or equivalent label
- Only the main session may use `Role: orchestrator`
- Delegated agents must use only the assigned specialist role label
- Delegated agents must not identify themselves as orchestrator, coordinator,
  or generic worker in user-visible output
- Delegated task messages must not begin with `Role: orchestrator`

## Task Handoff Format

Each delegated task must include:

```yaml
task:
  objective: '<clear, scoped description>'
  assigned_to: '<agent-name>'
  active_role: '<same as assigned_to>'
  files_allowed:
    - '<path pattern>'
  context: '<relevant background or constraints>'
  acceptance_criteria:
    - '<verifiable condition>'
  output_format: '<changed files list + risk summary + verification run result>'
```

## Done Criteria

- All delegated tasks returned with verification passed
- No unresolved cross-area conflicts
- QA report produced by `qa-agent` with verdict PASS (see `docs/reports/`)
- Integration gate passed in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  `validate-agent-runtime-contracts`, `lint-and-test-frontend`,
  `lint-and-test-backend`, and `docker-build` must all pass

## Session Handoff

When a session is ending or context is getting long, write a handoff file:

- Path: `docs/sessions/handoff-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Use the template at `docs/sessions/handoff-template.md`
- The next session must start by reading the latest handoff file

## Forbidden

- Direct domain changes to `frontend/**`, `backend/**`
- Bypassing specialist ownership to resolve conflicts faster
- Delegating without explicit acceptance criteria
- Delegating through a runtime transport label without naming the repository
  specialist role explicitly
- Beginning a delegated task message with `Role: orchestrator`
- Allowing delegated output to present as `Role: orchestrator`
- Starting a new session on in-progress work without writing a handoff first
- Remaining in `Role: orchestrator` while editing specialist-owned files in
  fallback mode
